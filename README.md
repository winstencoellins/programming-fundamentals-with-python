# Programming Fundamentals with Python by Chi - Gen
In this course, I will be guiding you step by step in order to have a good understanding about the world of programming. By the end of the course, I expect my students to understand the very basic concept of OOP before starting / choosing their career in the world of tech. 

## Week 1
#### Materi untuk Week 1 tersedia pada folder Week 1
During the first week, you will be learning the basic convept of programming which are to understand how to write your first program, how program works, types of data, and the usage of function in Python.

## Final Week
During the final week, you will be focusing on learning OOP and spending the rest of your time doing a project together with me. This project is meant to let you to have a gist on what programming looks like in the real - world. Developing your own source code and help your company to grow in the real - life experience.
